# <Project name>

<One-sentence description of what the project does.>

## Always read first

Before doing any work in this repo, **always read all** of these:

- @docs/CONCEPT.md — <one line specific to this project: what the system does, primary domain entities, key lifecycles, UI/UX scope>
- @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md — <one line specific to this project: stack choices, topology, state model, project layout>
- @docs/CHANGELOG-DIGEST.md — the curated decisions and milestones of this project.

Then two more steps, as **actions** rather than loads — no `@`-reference can express "the newest N files of a folder", so this part is yours to fetch:

1. `ls docs/changelog | tail -40` — the index. Every entry is its own file named `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, so the listing alone says what has been worked on lately and hands you the path to read. An absent folder just means no entries yet.
2. Read the **newest 10** in full, plus any further entry the index shows bears on what you are about to touch.

This is the one piece of orienting context you have to go and get, and skipping it fails quietly — you run on the digest alone and re-litigate the last few days with nothing signalling that anything is missing. So before you write a changelog entry, confirm you did it: *did I list `docs/changelog/` this session?*

`CONCEPT.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` are the source of truth for *what* we're building, what we've built, and *how* it's structured. If something in the code contradicts them, either the code or the doc is wrong — flag it rather than guessing.

## Changelog discipline

Every change you make to this repository must be recorded in `docs/changelog/` as **its own file**, named `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — the date you write it, then a 2–4 word kebab-case slug. Same shape as `docs/specs/`. There is no single changelog file and there are no entry numbers: one file per change is what makes two parallel changes unable to collide, because no two can reach for the same path.

- **The file has two tiers, bounded differently.** A `#` heading, then a **lead** of **1–5 lines, ~20 words per line at most** — never one packed run-on line, since a 40-word run-on isn't a short entry, it just hides the bulk on a single line. Below it, a **`## Detail`** section — **owed whenever one of these exists, omitted only when none does**: an alternative you rejected (so nobody re-introduces it), a constraint that still binds, a known limit or deferred follow-up, a gap a future session would otherwise assume your verification covered. Write it now or not at all: these live in the context of the session that made the change and are gone when it ends, which is why the section is owed here rather than merely allowed. **It never restates the lead** — padding, not omission, is what goes wrong with a section nothing bounds by length. The lead is bounded because it is what a session reads to orient; the detail is bounded by *purpose*, because nothing else bounds it now that entries no longer share a file. Past ~40 lines of detail the change wanted a spec — write one and link it.
- **Write the lead as durable project memory, not a recap of the diff**: what is now *true that wasn't before* — new behavior, state, or rule — plus, in a clause and only when it isn't obvious, the *why*. Skip filenames, mechanical edits, and refactors with no behavior change; the diff and commit already hold those. Self-check: *if a future agent reads this before the code, does it learn what changed, why it matters, or what's now safe to assume?* If not, it's noise.
- **A landed entry file is never renamed, moved, or deleted.** Its path is its address — other docs, specs and code comments cite it by slug — and this is the one thing here that can break silently. Two changes claiming the same path is a merge conflict, which git blocks; a rename produces no conflict and breaks every citation to that entry with nothing noticing. **Cite in the other direction too:** when your change revisits, narrows or reverses a decision an earlier entry recorded, name that entry's slug in yours. That makes the chain greppable instead of something a future session has to reconstruct — and it is how rationale reaches back past the recent window without any entry growing.
- Write the entry as part of the same change. One file per change: don't batch several changes into one file, and don't skip entries. If a change is genuinely several, give each its own file.
- **Where `HEAD` is doesn't matter.** On `main`, on a PR branch, in a worktree — the entry file is written the same way in all of them, with nothing staged or moved at any point, because the file you write is the file that lands.
- **When a change is a milestone, or carries a decision a future session must not re-litigate, add a line to `docs/CHANGELOG-DIGEST.md` as well** — one to three lines, naming the entry's slug. The digest stays in required reading, so it is the only place distant history is guaranteed to be seen from; the window above reaches back a few days at most. Keep it small: when it passes ~100 lines, tighten its older half rather than growing it. It is also the one file two parallel changes can both append to — if that conflicts, keep both sides in either order, because the digest isn't sequenced.

Same change, bad vs. good entry — `docs/changelog/2026-03-14-expired-refresh-tokens.md`:

- **Bad** (short, but just recaps the diff — zero orientation value):
  ```
  # Auth changes

  Updated auth files, reworked middleware, added tests, renamed AuthHelper.
  ```
- **Good** (states what's now true, with the why in a clause, and puts the rejected alternative where it can't rot):
  ```
  # Expired refresh tokens rejected before session lookup

  Auth now rejects expired refresh tokens before session lookup; stale sessions can
  no longer silently renew. Validated at the middleware boundary, so handlers can
  assume every request they see is current.

  ## Detail
  - Rejected checking this in the session store: the store can't tell "expired" from
    "never existed", so the error the client got would have been wrong.
  ```

## Nested guidance

Each `src/` subtree (or service / package / area) has its own `CLAUDE.md` with scoped tool/skill rules:

- `src/<subtree-a>/CLAUDE.md` — <one-line scope>
- `src/<subtree-b>/CLAUDE.md` — <one-line scope>

## Reviewing changes

**This repo has exactly one review point: the commit.** Do not review after every edit, and do not run an unrequested review pass mid-session. A pass per prompt costs more than it catches — it only ever sees its own turn's edits, and the next follow-up re-opens what it just looked at.

What does *not* wait for the commit is verifying your own work: run the tests, the build, and whatever the subtree's `CLAUDE.md` mandates, per change, as always. Deferred here is the *review*, not the checking. Never report a change complete on the grounds that its review comes later.

The commit is the right moment because it's when the diff is sealed into history, and because it's the first point where the accumulated diff can be read as **one change** — which is what a review needs. Reviewed edit-by-edit, from inside the context that just wrote each one, a review sees the least and repeats its own blind spots.

**So when the user asks you to commit (or commit and push) and the working tree holds non-trivial changes, ask before committing** — `AskUserQuestion`, three options in this order:

1. **`/code-review high --fix`** — the deep pass: broad coverage, correctness plus reuse / simplification / efficiency, repairs applied to the working tree.
2. **`/fix-code --fix`** — the tight pass: every finding rated by consequence and independently verified, only the serious and unambiguous ones repaired.
3. **Commit now** — skip the review and go straight to the commit.

The first two are both real reviews; they differ in breadth and cost, not in whether the change gets looked at. **Option 1 leads because it catches the most** — recommend it for the diff this gate usually sees (accumulated over several rounds, or landed by a fan-out), and option 2 when the diff is small, contained, and already well understood.

**Label each option with the path that will actually run**, so the choice is concrete rather than abstract. `/code-review` ships with the harness, so option 1 is always available exactly as written — keep the explicit `high`, because without a level the command silently reuses whatever level was typed last. `/fix-code` is an installed skill: when it isn't present, option 2 becomes **"Review inline"** and you run that review yourself. Don't hide which of these the user is about to get behind a generic label — they differ in cost and in calibration.

**You** run the pass; the user is only choosing whether it happens and how deep it goes. This is the one place the review flow stops to ask — there is no end-of-turn nudge to go run a review elsewhere.

- Ask **once per commit request**, not per round or per file. If the user picks a review, run it, report, then continue to the commit without asking again.
- **Skip the question** when the diff is trivial — a typo, a version bump, a changelog line — or when a full review pass has already covered this working diff since the last edit. Asking there is noise.
- **Any** commit request goes through the gate, including a delegated one (`/git commit`, `/git commitandpush`) — check it before handing off, not after. A skill or subagent that does the committing never sees this rule.
- If the user picks *Commit now*, that's the answer — commit as asked, and don't re-offer or hedge about it afterwards.

### Running the review pass

**Option 1 — `/code-review high --fix`.** It reviews the current diff at high effort: broader coverage than the lower levels, including findings it isn't fully certain of, which is what you want at a gate that fires once per commit. Its brief is wider than option 2's — correctness bugs *and* reuse / simplification / efficiency cleanups in the same pass — and `--fix` applies what it finds to the working tree after the review. Its own report stands; don't restate it. Being the broader path, it will also repair things option 2 would have deliberately left alone, so read the resulting diff before committing rather than assuming every edit was a blocker.

**Option 2 — `/fix-code --fix`, whenever that skill is installed.** It resolves the diff scope itself, rates every finding 1–5 by consequence, has an independent verifier refute each one before repairing, takes a restore point first, and applies the repairs that are both serious and unambiguous — reversible via `/fix-code --undo`. Its own report stands; don't restate it. Two things it deliberately does *not* do: it leaves severity-1 and -2 findings unrepaired, and it treats style / naming / reuse as `/simplify`'s job and deep security work as `/security-review`'s. Run those separately if the change warrants them.

**When `fix-code` isn't installed, option 2 is that same review run by you, inline over the working diff.** A missing skill doesn't remove the review — it only changes who performs it. Scale it to the diff:

- **Small, contained diff** — read it yourself in one careful pass.
- **Substantial or complex diff** (what an accumulated multi-round working tree usually is) — fan the review out across **subagents via the Agent tool** (individual agents; this needs no ultracode opt-in — that gate is only for the Workflow tool), **one per dimension that's actually at risk in this diff (typically 2–4)**, then **verify each finding before acting on it**. Review finders run on the strong model; verification can drop a tier (the same tiering as *Multi-agent workflows* below). If the Agent tool isn't available, do the same review yourself in one thorough pass.

Check, across the diff: **correctness, security & data-integrity, edge cases & tests, reuse / duplication, clarity, performance, and conformance to this repo's own conventions** (the CLAUDE.md rules and established patterns). Then **apply every fix to the working tree automatically** and report:

1. **Group the applied fixes by severity** — blockers (correctness bugs, data loss, security), should-fix (clear improvements, missed reuse), nits (style, naming, minor clarity).
2. **Summarize each bucket in one line** so the user can see what was fixed without expanding every finding.
3. Do not stop to ask which to fix — all findings are fixed by default. The user can read the diff and revert anything they disagree with.

Every path closes the same way: say plainly what the review couldn't settle — you guessed at intent, left a known gap, or nothing covers it — so the user knows where their own judgement is still needed. State it as a fact about the change, not as a recommendation to run anything.

## Multi-agent workflows

When you fan a task out across subagents — the Workflow tool ("ultracode") — tier each agent's model and reasoning effort to the work, so cost tracks value instead of every agent defaulting to the strongest (most expensive) model:

- **Strongest model** (the session model) — contracts, correctness-critical implementation, adversarial review (finding unknown problems), and any verification or synthesis that needs design judgment or where a wrong call silently drops a real defect (security, data-integrity, correctness blockers). Never downgrade these; they are where quality is won or lost.
- **Mid model** — build/test runners, straightforward mechanical implementation, verifying concrete already-stated findings (the review did the catching), and applying already-decided fixes.
- **Cheapest model + low effort** — i18n, styling, and other boilerplate.

The guardrail: the stage that *catches* an unknown problem (review) stays strong; a stage that only *checks* or *applies* an already-identified one drops a tier by default — escalate a verifier back to the strong model only for subtle or security-/data-integrity-critical findings. For a small finding set, fold verification into the fix-apply agent (verify-and-fix in one pass) rather than one strong agent per finding. Set this per `agent()` call (`model` / `effort`); an agent that omits `model` inherits the session model, which is why an untiered fan-out silently runs everything on the most expensive tier.

**Invoking a named workflow is not authoring one.** The tiers above are yours to set only when *you* write the `agent()` calls. A built-in or named workflow carries no model overrides of its own, so every stage inherits the session model and a wide fan-out bills every agent at the top tier. Size the run before launching it — how many agents the fan-out implies, given the work it's spread over — rather than planning to retier afterwards; editing the `scriptPath` a run reports is a per-run patch, and resuming re-runs every stage from the edited `agent()` call onward, so the untiered agents get billed twice.

**A workflow's aggregate diff is what the review gate is for.** A fan-out edits files across several subagents — often in separate worktrees — so no single agent ever saw the whole combined change, and any review stage *inside* the workflow checked its own findings, not the landed diff. This doesn't earn an extra pass on return; the commit is still the review point. But when the gate asks, say the diff came out of a fan-out — it's where the deep pass earns its cost most clearly, so recommend option 1 there, and if the review falls to the inline path it gets the substantial-diff treatment above even when every agent's own slice looked small.

This section is inert unless you actually run a multi-agent workflow.

## Git workflow

<This section is **two independent choices**, not one. First: where commits ultimately land — keep one of the two modes under *Where commits land*. A mode is its **bolded line plus every unbolded paragraph up to the next bolded line** — Branch + PR is two paragraphs, not one — except the final two paragraphs of that subsection (*where, not when* and the review-gate pointer), which are mode-independent and always stay. Second: whether work here is ever isolated in a git worktree — keep or delete the *Working in a worktree* subsection. They compose. A repo that commits straight to `main` and also sometimes uses a worktree keeps **both**: the mode governs where work lands, the subsection governs how a session behaves while it's in a worktree. Delete this note.>

### Where commits land

**Direct to `main`** — when you commit, commit straight to `main`; don't open branches or PRs unless asked. <Push policy, e.g. push after each commit, or leave pushing to the user.>

**Branch + PR** — never commit directly to `main`. For each change: branch from `main` (`<naming, e.g. feat/<slug>>`), commit, push, then open a PR. <Who/what merges; note here if `main` is protected.>

Nothing about the changelog is special at landing here: the entry file is written on the branch with its change, per *Changelog discipline* above, and it rides the PR and merges with it. No other PR can touch that path, so nothing about the entry goes stale however long the PR sits open — which is why there is nothing to stage and nothing to remember at hand-off.

**This setting only chooses *where* commits go — not *when* to make them.** Commit only when the user asks; finishing a change is not a cue to commit it. When you do commit, each commit is one complete change including its changelog entry file — never leave the tree half-committed.

A commit request first passes through the review gate in *Reviewing changes* above — check it before staging anything, wherever the commit is being made: a commit inside a worktree is still a commit.

### Working in a worktree

<Keep this subsection if worktrees are ever used here; delete it otherwise. Everything in it is **additive** to the mode above, and applies only while a session is actually inside a worktree.>

**Where you are is a fact to check, not a setting to remember.** The same repo gets worked both ways — most sessions in the main checkout, some in a worktree — so before you commit, determine which. `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-dir --git-common-dir` prints two paths: identical in the main checkout, different in a linked worktree. The `--path-format=absolute` is required, not decorative — without it `--git-dir` comes back absolute while `--git-common-dir` comes back relative whenever you are in a subdirectory, so a naive comparison calls every subdirectory of the main checkout a worktree. The first line of `git worktree list` is always the main worktree (documented ordering), and its first whitespace-separated field is the path the landing commands below need; if that line is marked `(bare)` there is no main checkout to drive and the landing steps don't apply as written. In the main checkout, the mode above is the whole story and nothing here applies.

Parallel features each get their own **git worktree**, on a short-lived local branch that exists only to back it — `wt/<slug>` under *Direct to `main`*, or the mode's own convention under *Branch + PR*, since there the branch will be pushed as the PR branch. Under *Direct to `main`* that branch is never pushed, and is deleted along with its worktree once you're finished with it; under *Branch + PR* it **is** the PR branch, so it's pushed and follows the normal PR flow. But landing is not finishing: after a landing, continuing to commit on that branch is normal. Drift is a landed branch nobody is working in any more. Starting parallel work means creating a worktree — never run two sessions against the same checkout. <Where worktrees live, e.g. `../<repo>.wt/<slug>` or `.claude/worktrees/<slug>` — if inside the repo, it must be gitignored; and any local setup that doesn't carry into a fresh one — `.env`, installed dependencies, build caches — and so has to be re-run there.>

**The changelog works here exactly as it does anywhere else.** Write the entry file into `docs/changelog/` with its change, per *Changelog discipline* above — nothing is staged here and nothing happens to it at landing. What *is* worth knowing is that what you read is the **base copy**: `docs/changelog/` and `docs/CHANGELOG-DIGEST.md` as they stood when the worktree was created, missing anything landed since. Orient from them, but don't conclude from them that something hasn't been done.

**What counts as a landing.** Under *Direct to `main`*, "push" can only mean `main`, so **"commit and push" means land it** — the words sound smaller than the action, so say which you're doing. A bare "commit" does not: that's a checkpoint on `wt/<slug>`, which still passes the review gate and then stops there. Under *Branch + PR*, pushing the worktree's branch is just a push; landing is the merge, and that mode's flow applies unchanged.

**Landing under *Direct to `main`*.** The commits on `wt/<slug>` are the review point — each passes the gate as it's made. Landing itself adds nothing to review, with one exception: a merge that conflicts, whose resolution is authored work (step 1). Everything else here is mechanical and gets no second pass. You **cannot** update `main` from inside the worktree — both `git push . HEAD:main` and `git branch -f main HEAD` are refused while `main` is checked out elsewhere — so drive the main checkout with `git -C` instead. The session never has to move:

1. **In the worktree:** `git merge main`, resolve any conflicts, commit. Merging `main` in first is what makes step 2 a fast-forward. Two cases, and the difference decides whether the review gate fires: a **clean** merge commits itself, and that merge commit carries no authored content, so it needs no review — this is the normal case, since no two changes here write the same file. A **conflicted** merge leaves the resolution uncommitted, and a resolution *is* authored work, so it goes through *Reviewing changes* before you commit it. Git stopping there is what keeps a hand-resolved merge inside a reviewed commit — you don't have to arrange it.
2. **Land it:** `git -C <main-checkout> merge --ff-only wt/<slug>`, then push per the policy above. **A refusal has two causes, and they need opposite responses — read the error before reacting:**
   - **`main` moved** (rejected as not a fast-forward) — re-run `git merge main` in the worktree, resolve anything it conflicts on, commit, then retry the fast-forward. Your changelog entry needs nothing done to it: it is its own file at its own path, so a landing race can't reach it.
   - **The main checkout is dirty** (`Your local changes would be overwritten by merge`) — `main` has not moved; the obstacle is uncommitted work over there, not the branch. This is what a session working directly in the main checkout looks like from here. Commit or stash there, then retry.
3. **Tear down — if the worktree isn't being kept (see below), and from the main checkout:** `git worktree remove <worktree-path>`, then `git branch -d wt/<slug>` — in that order, since the branch can't be deleted while its worktree exists. Two traps: `git worktree remove` run from *inside* the worktree succeeds by deleting your own working directory out from under you, and every command after it fails; and `rm -rf` on the directory leaves the worktree registered and the branch undeletable until `git worktree prune`.

**Landing under *Branch + PR*.** There is no local fast-forward and no `git -C` dance: the worktree's branch *is* the PR branch, so landing is the mode's normal flow — sync, push, and the PR merges. Step 3's teardown still applies, with one correction that matters: **after a squash or rebase merge the branch's commits are not on `main` by ancestry**, so `git branch -d` refuses and you need `git branch -D`. Judge whether the work landed by the **PR's state**, never by `git log main..<branch>` — that comparison stays non-empty forever after a squash and will tell you the work is unlanded when it shipped.

**A landing asks two things — in one `AskUserQuestion`, not two stops.** The gate's one-ask-per-commit-request rule still holds; the second question rides along in the same prompt: the review question from *Reviewing changes*, and what happens to the worktree once the work has landed.

- **Keep working here** — nothing is torn down. The branch stays and keeps taking commits. Do **not** call `ExitWorktree`: its `keep` returns the session to the original directory, which is the opposite of staying.
- **Remove the worktree** — run step 3 (with the `branch -D` correction above if the PR was squash-merged). The session leaves the worktree and the next prompt runs in the main checkout; put that in the option label, because this relocates the session rather than just tidying up.

**Keep is the default** — removal costs rebuilding whatever local setup doesn't carry into a fresh worktree; keeping only costs disk. **Skip the question** when the user already said which they want. **Don't offer removal at all** while anything in the worktree isn't landed — uncommitted changes, untracked files, or commits that haven't landed: keep it and say why. Under *Direct to `main`* "hasn't landed" means not reachable from `main`; under *Branch + PR* it means the PR hasn't merged, since a squash merge leaves the commits permanently unreachable and an ancestry check would withhold removal forever. If the review reported something it couldn't settle, keep regardless and say so.

**If the session entered the worktree with `EnterWorktree`** — and this subsection is the project instruction that authorizes using it — note that it branches from `origin/<default-branch>` unless `worktree.baseRef` is `head`, so local unpushed `main` commits aren't in there. **Land before exiting:** `ExitWorktree` with `remove` refuses while the branch holds commits that aren't on the original branch, and the only way through that refusal is `discard_changes`, which destroys the work. Note that refusal is ancestry-based, so a **squash-merged PR still trips it even though the work shipped** — that is the one case where the refusal is wrong and `discard_changes` is nonetheless the wrong answer. Confirm from the PR that it merged, then tear the worktree down with `git worktree remove` and `git branch -D` instead of routing through `ExitWorktree` at all. Land first, then `remove` — and only when that's the answer to the question above; if the answer was to keep working, don't call it at all. Its `keep` action is for stepping out of a worktree you intend to return to in a later session.

The worktrees a multi-agent fan-out creates are **not** this: they're ephemeral, they don't commit, and their edits land in the parent tree to pass a single gate there. A fan-out running in the main checkout is also the most likely reason a landing hits the dirty-checkout refusal in step 2.
